a healthy sea
It is not only the home of more than 700,000 species of life, but also essential for the survival of the entire planet. Providing jobs and food for billions of people, the oceans are critical to human health and well-being.

slide1
But now the ocean is in greater danger than ever. Pollution from various toxic substances such as plastics, destructive fisheries, and climate change are intensifying, putting the marine ecosystem under serious threat. However, if we work together, we will be able to save the sea and protect the many marine creatures and people who live in the sea.

article2
The use of fossil fuels is accelerating climate change and ocean acidification, putting our oceans at risk. Destructive fishing is destroying the habitats of marine life and pushing many species to the brink of extinction. Scientists say the extinction of marine life in the next century could be the worst since the age of the dinosaurs. But we can prevent this crisis. If we act together, we can save the sea and the creatures living in it from crisis and protect the green earth.
